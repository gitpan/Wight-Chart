NAME
    Wight::Chart - Save charts to images using phantomjs

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
    See Tests.

NAME
    Wight::Chart - Generate static charts

    This is pre-release software, everything could change and there are
    definitely bugs.

TODO
    The long term plan is to allow output to be dynamic (javascript) or
    static (emails) and there will be a Zoom FilterBuilder to do this.

    At the moment there isn't a unified source data definition (its library
    dependent. this will change.

    The charts are reloaded using a new instance every time. this is slow
    and pointless, in the future they will use the same phantom instance.
